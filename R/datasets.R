#' @description
#' a database of music for happy, sad, angry, relax emotions prepared by
#' selection of verbal and non-verbal music  from different genres of
#' Turkish music. The dataset is designed as a discrete model,
#' and there are four classes. A total of 100 music pieces are determined for
#' each class in the database to have an equal number of samples in each class.
#' There are 400 samples in the original dataset as 30 seconds from each sample.

#'
#' @description The first 5 variables are all blood tests which are thought to
#' be sensitive to liver disorders that might arise from excessive alcohol
#' consumption. Each line in the dataset constitutes the record of a single
#'  male individual.
#' Important note: The 7th field (selector) has been widely misinterpreted
#' in the past as a dependent variable representing presence or absence of
#'  a liver disorder. This is incorrect [1].
#'    The 7th field was created by BUPA researchers as a train/test selector.
#'    It is not suitable as a dependent variable for classification.
#'    The dataset does not contain any variable representing presence or
#'    absence of a liver disorder. Researchers who wish to use this
#'    dataset as a classification benchmark should follow the method
#'    used in experiments by the donor (Forsyth & Rada, 1986, Machine
#'   learning: applications in expert systems and information retrieval)
#'   and others (e.g. Turney, 1995, Cost-sensitive classification:
#'   Empirical evaluation of a hybrid genetic decision tree induction
#'   algorithm), who used the 6th field (drinks), after dichotomising,
#'   as a dependent variable for classification. Because of widespread
#'   misinterpretation in the past, researchers should take care
#'   to state their method clearly.
